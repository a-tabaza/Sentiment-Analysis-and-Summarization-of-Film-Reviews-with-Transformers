# Sentiment Analyisis for Ichi the Killer (2001)
## _Truly vile, yet critically lauded in online media criticism circles._

The context for this project is kinda of simple, I get this unbelievable urge to rage sometimes after I see a movie that is considered part of the whole extreme wave of new films, don't know the correct term for it, but extreme cinema in general.
This time I chose to run some basic sentiment analysis on this Ichi the Killer. A movie I despised with my whole heart.

The sentiment analysis and visualizations were made using IMDb user reviews. I'd like to include letterboxd as a source next time as well.

I used Python to scrape and compile the dataset, R for sentiment analysis and visualization.

Two take aways:
- I liked the word cloud that I was able to generate
- I really like how I was able to scrape IMDb reviews ESPECIALLY after I found out the IMDb datasets sell for $50-$400k

I used R-bloggers and Analytics Vidhya as resources, linked here:

It is always a very brave move for a film maker when they decide to adapt from a manga as manga often has aspects within it that can not be replicated in to a live picture.

Depictions of mutilation, decapitation, and just about every other outrage human beings can perpetrate on other people\\'s bodies (and some they can\\'t, at least not in a universe where the laws of physics as we know them are observed) have become common-place in movies and on television - half the TV shows in prime-time feature corpses in various states of dismemberment, decomposition and God knows what - but these endeavors only employ sadism as a hook, drawing in adult audiences with the promise of seeing something freakish and mortifying. These works are not involved with sadism the way Miike\\'s are, do not take the same insane relish in inventing new tortures, new forms of mortification. Looked at in this light, Miike\\'s Ichi the Killer represents some kind of high-water mark; it strives for a level of sadistic glee above what even most Japanese shockers do (and there are some shockers out there), and achieves what amounts to masterpiece status. Of course the word \"\"masterpiece\"\" is employed in strictly relative terms here; Ichi the Killer is not my idea of a masterpiece in the true sense, is not even my idea of what makes for good viewing, but one must acknowledge what Miike has created - nothing more or less than a classic in the field of shock cinema.\",/review/rw1328050/?ref_=tt_urv\\r\\n7,21 January 2007,maxyg18,7,\" Takashi Miike at his best\\n\",Ichi (Nao Omori) is a disturbed and brainwashed killing machine who dresses up in a superhero costume and is controlled by his mentor named Jijii (Shinya Tsukamoto).,/review/rw1328050/?ref_=tt_urv\\r\\n8,17 July 2002,ScriptDr,8,\" Over the top violence/ bizarrely fun/ Manga for the screen\\n\",\"Be warned - as early as the film\\'s titles - letters rising from fallen sperm - (The costumed killer ejaculated voyeuristically watching violence done by one of the other team of gangster killers).  You should either run screaming from the theater or stay for an over-the-top exercise in so much violence it becomes white noise and almost disappears.  Seen at the Cinematheque, here in Los Angeles, with an adult crowd - this unrated but surely X-cubed film was a delight to those who stayed  A few patrons fled in the middle of the screening but most got the point.  Bad guys pursuing bad guys - with genre formula being trashed at every point - the humor built and built.  Any good characters (children included) were decimated or tortured.  None were spared.  Yet the film is a romp - from the complaining co-workers who grumble about having to clean up blood-drenched murder scenes (they found intestines everywhere) to the sado-masochistic special effects.  The film has left turns into fantasy - then back again - it has intentional bad-acting scenes (from previously capable actors)- the camera work has a will of it sown - exposition that makes no sense.\",/review/rw1328050/?ref_=tt_urv\\r\\n9,17 October 2005,AdamBowl23,10,\" You can rip someone\\'s arm off with your bare hands!\\n\",\"What can one say about Ichi the Killer? I do have to say, without a doubt, it is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. I was afraid going in, after hearing all of the hype, that it would be gore just for the sake of gore. But the way it is portrayed and the characters are what really drive the movie and make it stand out from other gorefests. It may be my sick personality, but I found myself laughing a lot throughout the movie. There is a lot of black humor in the film, which I enjoy. I would not consider this a horror movie by any means though, as I was not scared at all while watching it and it had none of the tendencies of a traditional horror film. The only thing that kept me from giving it 10 stars is the ending, which is a bit abstract, but I\\'m sure it was intended that way. But I would recommend this film to anyone, cause it\\'s something everyone should experience. The only movie I could compare this to would be Dead Alive, and that is a very loose comparison. Just do yourself a favor and watch it.\",/review/rw1328050/?ref_=tt_urv\\r\\n10,18 January 2006,klesker,8,\" The Extreme Limits of On screen Violence\\n\",\"To be honest, I don\\'t know what to think of this film. Personally, I couldn\\'t think about it in a critical way like I do with most films purely because of the extreme levels of on screen violence. Essentially, the violence is the protagonist of this film and anyone who thinks otherwise is sorely mistaken. How can anyone know what the hell is going on when every five minutes or so there\\'s another scene of extreme brutality? \",/review/rw1328050/?ref_=tt_urv\\r\\n11,1 August 2005,LLAAA4837,,\" Extreme Comic Book Violence. The film is Like a Live-Action Comic Book!\\n\",\"What My title for this comment says should be a warning to some. That is why the viewer should probably be strongly warned of what this film has in it. Extreme Comic Book Violence. Before I watched this film, I knew that it would have a lot of violence, but I wasn\\'t expecting it to reach heights greater than what I thought. I didn\\'t think it was going to be as extreme as it is before I watched it. The film did shock me a bit.If you think films like Dead Alive, Battle Royale, Audition, Salo\\', and Caligula are as depraved as movies can be, be prepared to be disarmed. With that said, I will now talk about the film. The story is this. Kakihara is a bisexual sadist who enjoys doing sadistic things such as hanging people by hooks and dumping hot grease on them or pulling the flesh off of people\\'s face\\'s with his arms and legs. He is looking for his Yakuza boss who disappeared. Kakihara is sad because his boss used to play crazy and weird sexual games with him. Kakahara is sort of unaware of a boy named Ichi who runs around in a superhero outfit the the number 1 on it and has blades in his boots that he uses to kill evil people with in gory unrealistic fashions. Ichi is being summoned by a supposedly retired cop. From there on, the story of madness, rape, murder, and mayhem gets a little more complicated. This film, when you look past all the gallons of blood and the sadomasochism, is brilliant. It is full of humor and entertainment but that is not what makes it good. I admired it\\'s story and it\\'s completely risky way to tell what the adventure of all these corrupt people. The film is unafraid of shocking it\\'s viewers or going a little bit over the top to show who the characters are. The film\\'s style is that of a MANGA. It is very fast paced and quick in going on with the scenes. there is one scene in particular where a woman\\'s fingers are snapped. This scene is more shocking then it sounds due to the fact that you don\\'t realize it until it is made obvious. once it becomes obvious enough it jumps away from that scene. Not everyone will agree with me that this film is as good as it is. There are many people that see it just as a gross shocker with no purpose other then grossing us out. There is a purpose in this film though. Even if the meaning is harder then ever to decipher. But I like films that have a hard message to figure out. It makes me want to watch them more. I find this film to be a true Japanese classic that should be remembered by the few people that see it. Words cannot describe how much I love this film. ICHI THE KILLER is a true masterpiece that has a good plot, a good meaning, and a good, yet shocking, ending twist that will haunt you for days.

This tour-de-force of sadism as directed by Japanese auteur Takashi Miike is an unbelievable display of cruel and inhumane punishment, both to the characters inhabiting the film and anyone with a weak stomach. Anyone familiar with Miike\\'s other films, especially \"\"Audition\"\" will find this to be familiar, yet still interesting ground. The violence is so over the top that it\\'s hard not to laugh while watching it. How many times have you seen someone get their throat cut, only to have a literal torrent of blood spray out of the wound all over everything? How about a guy who cuts off the tip of his tongue as an apology to his bosses, rather than the traditional tip of the finger? How about a guy who gets cut in half lengthwise by a concealed boot blade, only to split in half and fall to the floor in two? One of the main reasons to watch this film is for Kakihara, the character played by Tadanobu Asano. A bleached blond sadomasochist, this guy easily ranks up there with any other anti-hero you can think of.

He\\'s an original artist, that\\'s for sure. Ichi is rather undescribable. It\\'s actually a bit difficult to get into; the plot is difficult to understand for a while. It\\'s more or less a yakuza film, perhaps mixed with a bit of superhero story. A gang boss has been murdered, and his men, lead by the sado-masochistic Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano), are out for revenge. They know only the name of the killer, Ichi, and that he\\'s a very messy murderer (the room where the first murder has blood spattered everywhere; even the ceiling is covered, and there\\'s nothing on the ground by guts). Ichi himself takes a while to show up, but when he does he is a snivelling mess (played by Nao Omori). Working as a waiter in a restaurant, he cries when his boss yells at him. It seems that his super killing ability comes from outside, from a man who is controlling him, Jijii (film director Shinya Tsukamoto, whose films appeal much more to me more than Miike\\'s). Having developed a suit with special powers, he gives it to Ichi and convinces him to kill `bullies,\\' because the same kind of bullies beat him up in high school and even raped his girlfriend. Ichi\\'s memories are sketchy at best; in reality, Jijii invented them, but Ichi is a very impressionable person. I really liked the inventive villain and hero in the film. Kakihara is one of the all-time great bad guys. His character design (which appears on the DVD cover) is wholly original. Even though Ichi is also a very original character, most viewers, I think, will go away with the memory of Kakihara\\'s open maw. I don\\'t know, though. There are so many moments of utter brilliance here, but I really can\\'t get into Miike\\'s sense of pacing. It\\'s certainly unique. People have gone so far as to compare Audition with Ozu. That\\'s simplistic. Miike\\'s films are probably slower to develop than Ozu\\'s! I can appreciate it, but, man, when I\\'m in the mood to watch something culty and violent, I really would rather watch a faster film, like the ones made by Shinya Tsukamoto.

If you watch this movie with an open mind, you will notice there is not one single dull moment and this is not an exaggeration.

Though I enjoyed FUDOH, it wasn\\'t what I would call a great movie. After reading the synopsis, I expected ICHI to be little more than a PULP FICTION-style thriller. Never a fan of John Woo or filmmakers of that type, I settled in to watch ICHI with slightly lower expectations than FUDOH (which, again, I enjoyed, but did not find great). Boy, was I ever in for a shock. The violence of FUDOH does not even begin to compare with that of ICHI... and FUDOH was one hell of a violent movie! More importantly than that, however, was the fact that beyond its often astounding violence was a great story filled with fascinating characters. Filmed in a super-fast-paced style, ICHI tells the story of ruthless yakuza assassin Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano is absolutely terrifying!), a maniac with a sadistic streak a mile wide and a masochistic streak just as wide, who goes on a rampage to find his boss, who has disappeared with a large sum of money. In his search for the missing ganglord, he quite literally leaves a trail of blood and guts behind him. His outrageously violent methods anger the other members of Japan\\'s organized crime world, to a point that they enlist the help of the mysterious titular character in disposing of the maniac. Ichi remains unseen (or so we think) till well into the film (and his appearance is one of the biggest shocks of all), with only his gruesome handiwork on display till then. It all sounds very ordinary (or at least it did to me), but the beauty of this film (as well, I am led to believe, as Miike\\'s others) is the director\\'s ability to completely pervert the conventions of the crime thriller in order to deliver something that more closely resembles David Cronenberg than John Woo or Quentin Tarantino: this is no hip, tongue-in-cheek gangster comedy. Miike plays for keeps, as evidenced by the frequently disturbing imagery and subject matter. The acting in the film is worthy of mention as well. As stated before, Asano is very effective in the principal role; Shinya Tsukamoto (director of the wonderful TETSUO films) appears as a seemingly cowardly retired yakuza boss with a few schemes of his own; and almost everyone else leaves a very distinct impression (there is one actor in particular, who sounds as though he has some kind of breathing problem, who I will never forget, and I can\\'t remember the character\\'s name). Though often painful to watch (and I mean that in the most literal sense), there is a real and palpable beauty to the proceedings, which is due no doubt in part to the cinematography as well as the great editing. I read a review of this movie somewhere that said it was like one of the ultraviolent movies that Malcolm McDowell is forced to watch in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE as part of his brainwashing. I find that an amusing comparison, and it should let the viewer know what he or she is in for. I agree with the prevailing opinion among the true fans of this movie that calling ICHI THE KILLER a \"\"splatter\"\" movie is almost an insult; I think this is probably one of the best movies of the past decade, and deserves recognition as more than just a gorefest or crime thriller. Plus I love the ending. Since watching this movie I\\'ve become a huge fan of this guy\\'s movies.

It\\'s Takashi Miike after all, the controversial Japanese filmmaker that embellishes in squeamish violence. Whilst there is no doubt that the onscreen torture and explicit gore warrants the extremities that Miike addresses, it\\'s tonally inconsistent and occasionally dull. A psychologically damaged individual, who has been manipulated into killing, is being pursued by a sadomasochist. The media frenzy when video games became mainstream was inescapable. Miike took that absurdity and conveyed it through visceral killings that have found their own notoriety. Ichi plays \\'Tekken 3\\' every night, and starts to assume the fighting stances of the characters (I do love me some Yoshimitsu). The neck slicing and body chopping from the blade attached to his shoe made for some hilarious death sequences. Although plagued with unnecessary poor visual effects, it created some enjoyment. Conversely, we then have Kakihara who utilises unethical torture methods to get the answers he requires. Suspending Yakuza members with chains hooked to their fleshy backs and piercing them with giant needles. Excellent use of prosthetics and a superbly fun performance from Asano. These darker scenes of torture juxtapose the humorous slicing from Ichi, further emphasising the exaggerative perspective of the media. The problem is the narrative then becomes tonally inconsistent. Once you see one kill from Ichi, your mind becomes numb to the torturing that follows. Ichi is also arguably the less interesting character, succumbing to insufferably childish behaviour. Shifting the narrative focus on him instead of Kakihara coincidentally slowed the plot\\'s pacing as you don\\'t particularly care for him. I\\'d rather watch \"\"Kakihara The Torturer\"\".

At least not when it comes to Ichi The Killer ( popular American release title ) This film is way overrated and can easily be skipped. Not like Battle Royale (just to give one example) wich is a whole lot better. It looks like a magna-story and I\\'m not quite sure if it was meant to be like that. The hero is a funny looking young man with blond hair. At least he\\'s separable from all the other, resembling, characters. This sir is very special to say the least! There are two long cuts on each side of his mouth. When he smoke a cigarette, the smoke comes out through these cuts!! That was pretty funny in a very stupid way.Not cool or anything. He does very weird stuff like cutting off his own tongue. Talking about motivation ! It\\'s meant to be some sort of apology towards a gang-leader whom he almost tortured to death. Anyway, that\\'s what the whole story is about. A gang-leader got kidnapped and his closest and most violent assassin does everything to find him back. He\\'s the only one who\\'s still convinced the leader is alive...I agree that Ichi, the Killer contains lots of violence. But I don\\'t think it\\'s artistic or breaking new grounds or anything. I don\\'t even think it\\'s disturbing...Disgusting is a more appropriate word. I love a good amount of gore in my movies but there was something wrong with this.

Based on the manga of the same name, this cult masterpiece from renowned director Takashi Miike (One Missed Call), this follows Kakihara on his search for the man who killed his mob boss.\",/review/rw1328050/?ref_=tt_urv\\r\\n59,3 August 2008,ltlacey,7,\" When an organized crime boss goes missing the gang\\'s #1 henchman goes in search of answers.\\n\",\"Definitely a cult classic with all the elements: Drama, action, a basic storyline, and lots of violence and some sex. If you are troubled with the idea of torture, even though on screen, IMO, it\\'s not as terrible as some people have claimed (for example Tarantino\\'s Kill Bill series), then stay away from this movie. We have a basic premise that within a small area are 2 major yakuza, or organized crime gangs, along with fringe gangs. Those that were kicked out of one of the gangs or never made it into one. The big boss, or father (I\\'ll get back to this theme) goes missing and his loyal henchman, Kakihara, is out to find out where he has gone, since also missing is a lot of money. That part of the story was never that clear. Why would this man have with him so much money when all he was doing was getting with his favorite prostitute to have some sick sex? Kakihara is your extreme sado-masochist who puts his heart and soul into what he does. Literally. He takes his job seriously and likes to make sure it\\'s done right, so we get a lot of scenes full of violence. So while he is out torturing and killing members from the other gang and the fringe gangs he suspects had something to do with the disappearance of his boss (who he loves like a father) , as well as using some police to help in his hunt and torture tactics, we also have a young man, Ichi, being told what to do by Jijii, which is to kill even more gang members. This is a typical master and puppet scenario and it was not until I read through all the posts and thought back over specific scenes that this movie began to make sense. This is not just a violent movie with a lot of mentally sick people (as everyone was) thrashing about, but a story about fathers and sons. Literal and figure fathers. We have the crime boss who is Kakihara\\'s \"\"father,\"\" but somewhere in the beginning of the movie, with all the flashbacks and quick lines about how he liked being tortured as well as torturing people, I got a sense that Kakihara\\'s father was behind all of what was going on and that this person was Jijii. But Jijii cannot be the person who performs these deeds, so needs a puppet to control in order to do this as there are so many people that must be dealt with first to get to the real target. Enter Ichi, a mentally disturbed young man who is easily manipulated. So Jijii sends Ichi out to wipe out everyone on his way to the final person who Jijii really wants to kill: Kakihara. This would explain the final scenes, especially the one where Jijii is moving aside the hair on Kakihara\\'s face. It\\'s not to see if Ichi sliced him, but a loving and caring gesture that a parent would do for one\\'s child (let\\'s say if the child is sick or dead). That was the 1st and only thing that came to mind when I saw this scene and for me confirmed my 1st thought that there was a link between Jijii and Kakihara. In that scene we see the happiness on Jijii\\'s face that he got his revenge, but also the sadness because this was his son and now his only son is dead. Ichi did not kill Kakihara because Ichi could not follow through, as he was too emotionally depleted to do much more than lie on the ground and cry (after killing who he thought was his brother). It is what Kakihara wanted and he envisioned this scene to give himself closure. Plus, shoving needles into one\\'s brain through your ears (think lobotomy) could cause some mental lapses to occur. So Kakihara kills himself and Jijii has closure and now can kill himself. This frees Ichi from the puppet master and being manipulated and sets it up for a sequel.\",/review/rw1328050/?ref_=tt_urv\\r\\n60,9 December 2010,billybrown41,10,\" This one just gets better over the years....to me, anyway\\n\",\"This is one of those that (if you love it) you will only feel comfortable recommending to a select few people.

Koroshiya 1 is the most misogynist, violent, sadomasochistic, sexist film ever made. Yet I found myself loving this film. In some ways, this film could be considered deplorable: people are slowly tortured in the most original way, women are beat and killed in horrid ways, and the film is openly sexual. But where it catches you is in identifying with the characters. Kakihara, really the main character, is probably the best bad-a** villain you\\'ll love since Scarface. He is quiet, yet when he exacts his vengeance, his violent inner self is let out one sickening misdeed at a time. On the other hand, you have Ichi, the main character, who is the kid from high school who bullied all the time, but when pushed to the limit, wreaks a quick and terrifying vengeance. Kakihara gives pain because he doesn\\'t get enough; Ichi gives pain and death as a sign of affection and vengeance. So in turn, this turns from a violent action film to a bloody S and M romance. If you have the stomach to stand all the violence (which is comic-book-like, but still horrendously graphic), put this at the top of your list to see. If you can\\'t get into the story, you\\'ll at least like a lot of the photography and action scenes.\",/review/rw1328050/?ref_=tt_urv\\r\\n64,28 July 2009,mrspasm,8,\" What The Balls!?\\n\",\"I had no idea what was going on here. The Director, Mike Takeshi (An American of Japanese descent) is obviously a man filled with hate and dirty thoughts. Most of his films are filled with the most disgusting scenes this side of witnessing an insane man jogging at dusk near a duck pond with a couple of chocolate fingers protruding from his ears and his slippers made from potato skins. Itchy was filmed not with a traditional camera, but one made from blood. The story if you can even call it a story involves a cry baby who likes to dress up in kinky leathers. He goes around killing people with his shoes he covers their mouths and nostrils with them until the smell overwhelms them) and crying while he does it. I think there was a ghost inside him which was controlling his body, and all the real person could do was cry while the ghost killed everyone. Meanwhile another mental in a different part of the city is looking for someone equally psychotic to fight. He likes causing and feeling pain- we see several gruesome acts he partakes in including giving birth to a cow, cutting holes in his face so he can smoke out of them, attaching a man named Frank to a pile of fishhooks and pulling his flesh off, and juggling the sawn off legs of various prostitutes. Later he goes as far as tucking his trousers into his socks and pretending to be Woody Allen in need of a toilet. This is most disturbing.

Ichi is more of an action flick. I\\'m not a fan of the so-called \"\"torture porn\"\" - I find it rather boring. Therefore, what I find fascinating about Ichi is that, no matter how graphic it gets, I somehow never get the feeling of it being over the top. Most of the violence is so grotesque that it lacks realism and there are many comic-relief moments throughout, which seems very suitable for a film that\\'s based on a graphic novel. Of course, this film isn\\'t for everyone, and it\\'s absolutely hilarious to me when people write how disgusted they are - this isn\\'t a Disney film, nor has it ever been advertised as one.

ICHI THE KILLER proves this. Its both a funny, almost absurdist, nightmarish ride and at the same time an intelligent, serious, and disturbing examination of the futility of violence. The central character of Ichi, a shy and redundant young man at day, but under hypnosis becomes a violent and deadly killer, is the central \"\"superhero\"\" yet unlike, and a lot like most of your average superheroes Ichi has some serious flaws, including a disturbing fascination with rape, provoked by an incident in his childhood of seeing a schoolgirl getting raped by fellow classmates(again another made up story to provoke him to kill the bad guys), and unlike a superhero Ichi is being forced to kill the \"\"bad guys\"\", under hypnosis by Jiji, a former yakuza member played by TETSUO director Shinya Tsukamato. The cast play the roles superbly, especially the actor (sorry but can\\'t remember his name) who plays Kakihara, the masochistic gang leader of the anjo clan. Kakihara is both charasmatic and disturbing, willing to hurt himself just as much as other people, and he develops a fascination with Ichi almost seeing him as a partner in pain, who can replace his other pain partner and mentor, Boss Anjo, a recent target of Ichi. Many have labelled the film msogynistic, and i would disagree, as even though women are treated badly in the film the men are also treated violently, even worse, just witness the scene where Kakihara tortures a man by hanging him from the ceiling with hooks. The violence towards the female characters is disturbing, especially the opening scenes of the rape and beating of the prostitute who Ichi develops a fascination with. Yet also the violence overall can be seen to be sticking to the original anime comicbook source, as we see blood gush out in fountains, from victims throats and a man getting cut in half, down the middle of his body.

If you haven\\'t watched any of his movies yet, let me tell you that this film isn\\'t for lighthearted audiences. In the first five minutes alone, we see illegal gambling in a shady bar, a yakuza boss beating up and raping a prostitute and a voyeur masturbating to this instead of helping the poor woman. You will see prolonged torture sessions, people taking drugs and blood-red rooms filled with guts after intense massacres. Anyone who criticizes this movie for these elements or calls the viewers of it sick clearly didn\\'t inform himself what kind of movie he was about to watch. Japanese yakuza movies are usually over-the-top, graphic and for mature audiences only.

And it was certainly worth the hunt. It was completely and utterly different than anything I was expecting. Everything that I had heard about it underlined the extreme gore and violence, to the point that I figured that is all it had to offer. However, when watching it, I didn\\'t seem to notice the violence at all. I was totally engrossed in this world of criminals and assassins. I think the single most interesting thing about the entire film was the choice of the hero. Sure it\\'s technically Ichi, but it\\'s really Kakihara\\'s movie. Ichi is a bit distant and overly emotional for viewers to root for. And the audience is almost forced to root for Ichi\\'s opponent. Kakihara is by no means a hero (He tortures his way through the entire movie, mostly inflicting pain on people who seemingly don\\'t deserve it.) and yet the audience is drawn to him. Miike deserves immense praise for taking a seemingly disgusting character with little redeeming value and making him the sympathetic lead.

Maybe it is because I am not a fan of manga (I actually think a good movie should be able to defend itself, without forcing the viewer to read a comic series prior to watching it)... After reading some of the comments here I was truly amazed to see that some people were actually able to make sense out of it all!

For me, it is worth sitting through and having all my senses brutalised for the sake of what the director is trying to do to his audience. Ichi the Killer is very beautiful underneath, and you need to have your sensitivity ripped away in order to really feel for the sadness of the characters. They are all searching for fulfilment, but they have become so desensitised to everything that now only pain can really touch them.

Well it is easily one of the greatest foreign films ever made. Right next to Akira Kurosawa\\'s Seven Samurai or his movie Ikiru. From the beginning part with the brutal beating and rape sequence, to the strange ending in which my favorite character in the movie Kakihara dies, is all good fun. Now, i have viewed many films in my time and nothing compares to the first scene of Yakuza Boss Anjo beating and raping a prostitute. Now knowing about Takashi Miike\\'s other films before i saw Ichi The Killer (Audition, Visitor Q, Dead Or Alive to name a very small fraction.) I knew this movie was going to be gory fun. Some parts of it seems tacked on or just thrown there for fun, like the part the man\\'s arm gets ripped off. Now it was rather comical and sick because it was definitely not needed in the film. But everything else in the film makes up for it. Normally i wouldn\\'t recommend a movie with intense gore and repulsive rape here and there. But this movie has a different meaning to it all and shows the audience, even challenges them to watch it almost. Ichi the Killer is a sick movie, and like my family members explain, is a perverted movie. Though i don\\'t believe what they think because they do not know good cinema. Ichi is rather about changing in life. The ACTUAL star of the film, a boy named Ichi, starts off as a scared little kid that is a Sadist. Now Sadism is weird and messed up, and Ichi does not realize why he likes to beat women and kill. But in the end, he changes from a scared kid who kills, to a human being rather.

Ichi The Killer is about this guy named Ichi that goes around and kills people. There is much more to the story though. You actually see Kakihara in the movie more than Ichi.

I absolutely love the character \"\"Kakihara\"\" Tadanobu Asano was just fantastic in this film, his torture scenes were easy to watch and you kind of giggle along with him. All the characters in the film have their own parts to play, the actor who portrays Ichi done a fantastic job, you do feel sorry for Ichi and after watching it a few times you do start to understand everything that had happened to him that makes him turn into the cold hearted person who could Kill anyone at the drop of a hat. I love the fact that in the film you see the work of both a Sadist and Masochist something which is hard to find in most films. I was extremely sad when Ichi finally got Kakihara in the end i was hoping that we would get another film out of it. i would have loved to have seen the sequel.

It\\'s a fun movie to watch. However, i had a problem that our main hero, Ichi, we dont really follow him as much, as the criminals, which is kinda a let down, when Ichi is the head-character.

Anyways, worth watching very sick and awesome. I wish they would have explained the history of Ichi more. I would also have liked to see more about the man with the piercing.

The mystique surrounding this film is wholly misplaced. It wasn\\'t particularly well made (I personally thought the film looked cheap) and, due to the excess gore throughout, distinctly lacking in tension. The only strong point of the film was the sadist \\'Kakihara\\'. A genuinely evil person, the potential for his character is never fully realised and the possible stranglehold he could have had on both the movie and the viewer is lost. Dripping semen, entrails, a man being sliced in half down the middle, these things didn\\'t shock me in the slightest, the project\\'s comic book origins are palpable and I feel the film suffers as a result. If this was Miike\\'s intention then that is fair enough but the film is billed and advertised as being something entirely different to it\\'s reality. \\'Visceral\\' and \\'ground-breaking\\' this is not. The biggest let down is the \\'mysterious\\' character of Ichi who turns out to be a baby-faced, timid, emotional wreck. His character\\'s confusion and angst is well portrayed but he is in many ways a complete disappointment, once again due to what you thought he was going to be not matching the reality. The movie isn\\'t even visually striking (as i mentioned it looks quite cheap), aside from some interesting camera-work at the start which for me simply emerged as a metaphor for the film itself, a disappointing false promise.\",/review/rw1328050/?ref_=tt_urv\\r\\n189,25 February 2004,TM-2,9,\" Brutal and somewhat stylish\\n\",\"Ok, so it\\'s not for everyone.

Director Takashi Miike is an iconic figure of this genre, seemingly trying to push the limits in the depiction of bizarre violence the he established himself, via a volume of films that would put to shame even the most prolific B-Movie directors of the 90s.

The film is literally a comic book come to life, but, It doesn\\'t dwell constantly on violence and sexual violence to make its impact, like many other horror films do today. Whereas Hostel and saw try their hardest to be offensive and shocking simply because kids and young adults like it, This film doesn\\'t feel like its trying too hard. Yes, I know I\\'ve blasted torture porn films in my other reviews, and this could be considered torture porn as well,but this film has more to offer then just torture and violence.

While that certainly doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not revolting or disgusting (I\\'ll get back to that), it\\'s visual representation of violence is hardly shocking enough to justify the kind of walk-outs you frequently here about (in a local sneak preview about half the audience - 110 people - \\'ran in fear and disgust\\'). Why didn\\'t the violence shock me head-on? First of all, much of it is obviously CG, like the infamous Hannibal climax. Second, much of it (though certainly not all) is played so much for laughs.

It is completely not understandable and I think that one\\'s mind must be twisted to like it. When i saw it I wondered why these men are doing all of these things, what is the point, what do they aim? None could convince me that Ichi is some sort of hero.

Unlike Dead Alive, Ichi\\'s plot does deserve a second look. Set in modern day urban Japan, the movie offers a highly stylized (this is Asian cinema) look at modern Japanese gangs- (We learn they corrupt the police and rule with just as much authority), and pokes around a bit for answers to that age old question, Why in the world are some people so hell bent on torturing others? The recurring themes of bullies and sexual perversity are treated in the extreme and by the end there is little room left for semi-Freudian conclusions about motive: Kids who are bullied like to get off by causing pain. But I have not put this as delicately as I should have. Ichi is not heavy handed with it\\'s characters and, without a bit of thought, (which is really an activity only for the hyper-analitical during this one...I mean, really, ya don\\'t have to think about pop-psychology to enjoy flying cut-off faces splatting against the wall), one might never notice the depth and delicacy of backstory given to each person. It\\'s only somewhere between wondering if you will ever flinch again and whether or not you will forget all your morals after seeing this film that you might think \"\"Why is Ichi a killer?\"\" At first glance, it\\'s a tasteless (yet uber-chic!) story of gangsters, hookers and pimps that would make Quentin Tarantino or any horror movie fanatic giddy with excitement and any other average Joe wondering if they should be offended by the extreme violence, tastelessness and mysogony. But the second look really opens up some of the psyche behind all that, and that\\'s the only thing that could ever help solve those problems. Condemning it certainly wouldn\\'t do the job. Good job Miike!\",/review/rw1328050/?ref_=tt_urv\\r\\n230,26 February 2002,quinolas,7,\" something more than just violence\\n\",\"Everything has been said about the extreme violence and sadism displayed in this film. The fact that many only talk of this violence is not not surprising, it is right in your face. This seems to have irritated some though. Contradicting a reviewer there is something else you could talk about this film apart from its violence and I\\'ll try to do so. So whether you like it or not Ichi the Killer forms part of the yakuza genre and it will be study in Japanese film studies as a variation of this particular genre. Why?, because Miike (by the way pronounced Meeke) Takashi likes subverting and playing with genres conventions. Yakuza genre conventions are used in this film too but taken to radical extremes as for example the homosexual overtones of oyabun- kobun (father-child or senior-boss & junior) common in yakuza films. This kind of relationship is not at the same level as heterosexual relationships. Women cannot compete with the oyabun. In Ichi the killer this is made clear in the scene when Karen, the Hong-Kong Chinese prostitute and Kakihara\\'s girlfriend, is trying to take up the role of Kahikara\\'s boss by beating him up, but as Kahihara tells she is not as good as his boss, there is no love in her beating. Sado-masochist and homoerotic elements have always been implicit in yakuza films (take as example Takakura Ken series of Shin Abashiri Bangaichi). In Ichi the Killer these elements are the main drive of its narrative. Even though Ichi is far from being Takashi\\'s best film I still felt intrigued by some of its elements. For example, why Karen speaks mainly in English. All Takashi\\'s followers should know by now about his interest in Chinese culture and people. Several of his films were shot in China. Chinese is spoken in many of his films, Rainy Dog for example, shot in Taiwan, Chinese (Cantonese) is the main language in this film. Can Ichi\\'s obsession with video games and being bullied at school (a common problem in Japan) explain the why of his violence?( this seems to be a pretty thin explanation though). More interesting and mysterious is the character played by Tsukamoto Shinya, Jijii, who manipulates Ichi into slaughtering rival yakuza. Jijii sets up CCTV cameras to show Ichi which guys he wants him to kill. As Ichi watches the monitor, Jijii sort of hypnotises him and convinces Ichi that those guys on the screen are actually the ones who bullied him in the past. Tsukamoto is himself a director of rather violent films too (Testuo I & II, Tokyo Fist...) Some reviewers have talked of not taking too seriously the violence in the film, as it is sort of comical. I wouldn\\'t call comical the sequence where a rival yakuza played by Terajima Susumu hangs from meat hooks while Kakihara is torturing him. Notwithstanding the comical gory scenes Takashi cannot help but end the film with a bleak note. Ichi has been used for killing worthless yakuza and that maybe the reason why the director turns the killings into gory comedy. But once an innocent boy, the son of the policeman- turned-yakuza played by Sabu, is killed the mood changes. In the final scene of the film Jijii is seen hanging dead from a tree in the foreground and in the background Ichi following a group of schoolchildren ready, for what it seems, to slaughter them. Ichi has eventually found his real bullies: children not yakuza. After killing Sabu\\'s character Ichi\\'s beaten up (to Ichi\\'s weak mind this could just be a re-enactment or reminder of his bullying paranoia)  by the boy. Ichi reacts by chopping his head off. Jijii realises that, this is just an assumption, he has created a monster. Takashi seems to be more sympathetic towards children than women (see for example DOA 2: birds). I\\'m a bit wary of Takashi\\'s treatment of women on this film, something that some reviewers have already pointed out. I\\'ve been suspicious about this since I first saw Shinjuku Triad Society where a prostitute falls in love with the main character, a Japanese-Chinese policeman, who had previously anally raped her. The reason: nobody else had ever made her to come until then... Uhmm... Dodgy stuff... In an interview Takashi has said that the reason why he gets rid of women so violently and quickly is because women tend to rationalise everything and he\\'s no time for providing a rational and coherent explanation for his films. Well, nobody is perfect.  Nevertheless Miike Takashi seems to be moving away from the straight to videos films (v-movies as they are called in Japan) he made on the first part of his career (all of them chinpira (wannabe yakuza) films rather than yakuza as I\\'ve been told). In the last 3 years he\\'s done comedies, musicals, social satires, horror films and of course still yakuza movies. Let\\'s see if his attitude toward women changes too.\",/review/rw1328050/?ref_=tt_urv\\r\\n231,8 September 2021,bthigdon,10,\" Strange Brews gone horribly wrong\\n\",This movie is as likely to make you smile as it is to make you vomit.

When it comes to onscreen violence, no other culture is as creative, brutal, and wierd like the Japanese.  Such is the case with Ichi the Killer, so much so in fact, that the story (or lack of it) is almost lost.  AS for the story, it begins with the dissapearence of a yakuza boss and a whole bunch of money.    So the new head of the yakuza Kakihara goes about the usual ruotine of finding out what happened by slowly torturing a rival yakuza underboss (if that what they are called).  This proves futile other than to show that they were being manipulated by the very person who told Kakihara that the underboss new somthing.  The manipulator, Jijii, doesnt stop, nor began, his manipulation with Kakihara, in fact, he is in complete control over one of the most bizarre killers in cinema history (in any culture) Ichi.  Not only is he completly oblivious to his real past, but so are we since its never fully explained.  All we know is what Jijii tells Ichi which is a whole bunch of lies about Ichi witnessing a rape and doing nothing.  What makes Ichi so bizarre is that he cries over everything (when we first see ichi, hes trying to make a decent living as a waiter, puked on a custumer, and then is crying about it).  He also cries right before, dring, and then after a kill as if hes both upset about his past (the rape memory) and of his present (being a killer).His only justification for what he does is that he is killing bullies.  Anyway, whjen Kakihara find out about Ichi, the story shifts from them trying to find out what happened to the Yakuza boss and more on Kakihara\\'s fascination with Ichi (Kakihara has a huge fetish for pain, so much so, that he broke a relationship becuase his girlfriend could not inflict the right amount of pain on him).  This storyshift peads to what is quite possibly the most anticlimantic and strange showdown ever (lets just say theres more crying in this one scene than an entire liftime movie).\",/review/rw1328050/?ref_=tt_urv\\r\\n236,22 March 2008,jtspitz,10,\" I cant say enough good things about this movie!\\n\",\"Take what you love from graphic novels and manga , combine it with stylish directing , an uncompromising look into sadism and masochism and give it a solid foundation and plot and you have Ichi the Killer.\",/review/rw1328050/?ref_=tt_urv\\r\\n237,27 March 2015,psyhuahua,9,\" Pain is a serious business\\n\",\"Badass movie.

What a weird flick. First of all, Im not all that familiar with Asian cinema, and the only other Miike film I\\'ve seen is Audition, which I love to death. Let me say that I definitely did enjoy Ichi. But this movie is one odd duck. I had to watch it twice in a row to understand what was going on, but after that second watching I think I understood most of it. (I still don\\'t understand where the kid got the tongue from...wtf?) And the two main characters are some of the most unique I\\'ve seen in a long time. My biggest problems with the movie are Miike\\'s fairly vague story structure, like flashbacks with no indication that you are watching a flash back can get fairly confusing. But the only thing I really disliked about it, and the reason my rating is not a 9 is his use of really obvious and bad CG for wounds and blood. Other than 1 or 2 things, his usage of CG was totally unnecessary. Almost everything could have been done with traditional effects, and they would have worked much better. Also, the level of blood when people were injured anywhere in the throat area. Not that the blood bothers me, but I just thought the movie would have been more effective with a more reasonably realistic amount of blood. But, that may be a stupid request of a film that is this off the wall. Overall, great flick if you can deal with the utter insanity of if. A truly demented film, but not as brutally violent as I expected. Oh, and since it seems to be compared to Oldboy a lot, Ill just say that I think Oldboy is easily the superior film. 7/10.

A brilliant film, the more you\\'re interested in THINKING about cinema, the more this film will reward you. It is perverse, audacious, bizarre, and indeed quite... funny? Well, not exactly; I can see why other IMDBers have disagreed about whether it can be called a comedy or not -- there were many times when I laughed aloud when watching the film, but it was more in, uh, shock and awe than amusement (But that\\'s the essence of humour, in a way, isn\\'t it, to prod us in sensitive, taboo pink spots? If so, this IS a comedy -- but it\\'s a cattle prod the director is using on us). I mean, I laughed uproariously when Kakihara grabbed his tongue by the piercing and cut the tip of it off, as a token of sincere apology to his yakuza bosses, who recoil, turn green, faint, etc... A minute later Kakihara has been to the hospital and is proudly displaying the stitches in it, which we get a gleeful little close-up of; it takes a certain TYPE of viewer to appreciate the humour in all this. (The tongue chunk, complete with piercing, is sent in a jar to an aggrieved mob boss -- Kakihara has been torturing him with hot oil while he hangs from hooks through his flesh -- but does nothing to appease the man, who seizes the tongue and crushes it, leaving us to wonder what it FEELS like to squeeze severed tongue... Or maybe that was just me). Miike is superb at foiling -- or, well, let\\'s say subverting and re contextualizing -- audience expectations, torturing us with our own sadism, rewarding us for our masochism -- giving us exactly what we don\\'t want when we don\\'t want it, or better, giving us what we thought we did want, yet in such an excessive way as to cause the jaw to drop -- while being bold enough to slyly comment on the whole process throughout, to ionize it -- a smart ass through and through, at least during this film. I mean, it\\'s hard to do the film justice on one viewing (and of the rated version, at that), but it\\'s smart stuff, tho\\' indeed, quite twisted. Tsukamoto Shinya is pretty fun, too, in a role that could be a parody of his manipulating/evil characters in his own films (I\\'m thinking of TETSUO II and A SNAKE OF JUNE, in particular).

If you just see Audition, you think he\\'s from another planet. But his movies as a whole are like some kind of overblown fantasy about Japanese society, families who can\\'t communicate, sexuality gone into overdrive, violence behind every facade. Ichi is truly the most over-the-top movie I have ever seen. It reminds me a bit of first discovering John Woo. Except that while Woo was inspired by Peckinpah and Jean-Pierre Melville, this guy\\'s influences seem to be gore comics, metal videos and his own unflinching take on modern life. Specifically, we\\'re talking about EXTREME s&m, rooms full of entrails, sadist twin cops wearing haute couture, an insane Yakuza with slits in his face, a man stuffed into a TV set and executed with skewers, a hero who is probably mentally ill and cries all the time, a man sliced in half, and a LOT of very disturbing rape fixations. That\\'s only the stuff that jumps to mind immediately. Pretty much every scene will surprise, shock, disturb or (depending on how hardened you are) amuse you. I left this film wondering who the intended audience could be. Japanese people, certainly. Committed seekers-out of the bizarre like myself, yes.

Beyond the gratuitous violence (which is more cartoony than horrific) is an examination of the human condition, or more specifically, the extreme hedonist condition. That much is obvious, but the interest lies in the contrast of Ichi and Kakihara not with each other but with Jijii. His motive in all of this, in manipulating Ichi and obsessing with Kakihara, is revealed during the climax: upon finding Kakihara\\'s body his face twists into a sort of butchery of sadness and happiness. It took me years to realize that in truth he does not feel both but neither; he is nothing, and his obsession with the two men that go to such extremes to feel alive results of his own desperate attempts to be; to learn to be. With both men gone he is left without an escape from his suffocating nothingness and hangs himself. In sum we are given a triad: the sadist, the masochist, and the nihilist.

I had read many reviews before viewing \"\"Ichi the Killer\"\" which proclaimed this film to be exceedingly gory and unnecessarily violent. After viewing the film, I found both positions to be false. The gore is no more than many mainstream American releases, and the violence, although unsettling at some points was on par with what you may expect from the average Kung-Fu movie. If anything, I was surprised by the absurdly comic value of some scenes within the film.

And even now, afte watching it several times, I don\\'t know if I can quite put what I feel about it into words. I liken watching this movie to looking at a horrible car accident. You see a couple of really smashed up cars, some blood, etc. It\\'s a horrible, disgusting scene that you shouldn\\'t want to look at. However, you become transfixed by the enormity of what you\\'re looking at and cannot look away. To say that this film is violent is a huge understatement. It makes Kill Bill or Reservoir Dogs or A Clockwork Orange look like Barney. However, like in Kill Bill, the violence is supposed to be over the top and somewhat not believable. I think that it\\'s more supposed to be about the messages that the director is attempting to convey. Another film that I liken this movie to is Bum Fights (I know this is weird, but bear with me...lol). Bum Fights is gross, disgusting, disturbing, and all around gut-wrenching, but I believe that it brings to lights an aspect of human life that most people choose to ignore and pretend that it does not exist. I am not agreeing with any of the horrible acts that happen in Bum Fights (or Bum Fights 2), just saying that it is something that everybody should see to open their eyes. So, to wrap this all up into a neat little package... If you\\'re fairly desensitized to violence, watch this movie, and be sure to get the full, uncut version. The cut version takes out some scenes which are fairly critical to the plot if you ask me. While the plot if fairly odd and hard to follow (I\\'m sure that a lot is lost in the translation), it\\'s enough to keep you glued to your TV set. I rank this movie a 10/10 because it still turns my stomach every time that I see it.\",/review/rw1328050/?ref_=tt_urv\\r\\n279,24 November 2004,mtreek,,\" Ending explanation. ***MAJOR SPOILER ALERT***\\n\",\"I just wanted to take the time to explain to some of the viewers of this movie what the ending was all about. During the rooftop scene at the end, after Ichi killed the former cop, the cop\\'s son came out and attacked him while he was wounded. Ichi couldn\\'t defend himself because he is a gentle person to those that are not \"\"bullies\"\" and would not hurt the child. As Kakihara is watching this, he is again led to disappointment by not having the masochistic pleasure of fighting Ichi. Since there is no one left to try and kill Kakihara, he decides to hurt himself by inserting the small spears into his ears. In doing so, he damages his brain but does not die. This is where it gets confusing. When Kakihara looks up, he sees Ichi standing there, ready to fight, and the boy\\'s dead body behind him. This is all a hallucination caused by the brain damage Kakihara just inflicted on himself. Ichi had actually died. Therefore, when they fight, and Kakihara has his forehead cut, it never actually happened. Kakihara went crazy and threw himself off the balcony. That is why there is no scar on the forehead when Jijii looks at him. Afterward, I am not sure if Kakihara actually dies or if he is just brain dead. In the final scene where Ichi is walking around with the children, he\\'s not there physically, but spiritually (hence the symbolism of the crow flying). He is protecting the children.\",/review/rw1328050/?ref_=tt_urv\\r\\n280,21 June 2006,brbr_opus38,9,\" Ichi is Miike at his most leopard\\n\",\"If you like extremely offbeat movies, you should check this out. They come along with a lot of violence, though, which isn\\'t the reason I like Miike\\'s movies; I don\\'t like violence per se. The main reason I like his films is because he depicts his characters and the situations that they are in so well. All of his movies are very unique from one another. Sometimes the violence will be so extreme and stylized that it\\'s to the point of being humorous (Ichi the Killer), but not as much as Kill Bill. And other times he will make you feel like what\\'s on your screen is happening for real. A lot of people compare him to David Lynch (Gozu is a good example), but you shouldn\\'t think of him that way. They are two completely different animals: Miike is a leopard(very smart, yet still capable of ripping your heart out) and Lynch is a regular, trained house cat (he can only scratch at you, and, while he does have a brain, all he\\'s interested in is confusing you for no good reason other than to get fed). Miike is far superior. I have noticed something about Asian cinema, and I think Ichi the Killer is a good example: They tend to not follow the same kind of pattern throughout that American movies do. American movies will usually keep to the point that they\\'re trying to make, and that\\'s it; they\\'re much more refined formulaically, but not necessarily better because of it. I see Fight Club as being very Asian in its style. There is so much happening throughout it (flashbacks,footnotes,random visuals). I can watch these movies over and over because there is always something that I\\'ve either forgotten about or didn\\'t even notice in the first place.

There\\'s some creative kills, trippy editing, and the theme of pain cycling between danger and pleasure is present. But how it\\'s reflected in the story comes off as convoluted, overindulgent, and inconsistent in tone. The portrayal of sexual violence flip flops between cartoonish and disturbing, robbing it of impact despite it\\'s notorious reputation. Ichi and Kakihara overshadow pretty much any character in terms of relevance (even Ichi\\'s handler), yet only one of them has a fully-fleshed out arc.

It is hard to care much about many of the people being tortured because there is no character development in most of them with the exception of Ichi and Kakihara.  Kakihara likes to be tortured, but only by those who are the best at inflicting pain.  Therefore he is very studied in the art of giving pain and practices this with relish.  There is a poor slob in the movie who is tied to a chair and has grossly enlared needles thrown at his exposed face and who knows what else is done to him before they get the idea to cut his unmentionalbles into several ribbons with a pair of scissors.  While there was little to no character development with this man it is hard not to be sympathetic to his plight. I felt a large rush of horror even though I am a female.  Ichi is interesting and has a strangely boyish face for one who is so unbalanced and capable of massive human destruction. It is hard not to feel sympathy for him as well because he is manipulated and used by someone who engages in mentally torturing him to achieve his ends.  At the end of the film we get some mixed up mental messages and  have to decide what to do with this information-Miike\\'s trademark as far as I can tell.

It was not because I wanted to, but had to. I am a realist when watching films; I remain as objective as possible. Yet even with such a mindset, I was forced into a space of uncomfortable surrealism.

I like violent cult movies, which is the reason I bothered to check this out in the first place, because I heard people talk about it. If they would have bothered to mention the stupid slow dialogue about how rape is cool, the close up on a puddle of semen, and the goofy kid who fights gangsters and then runs home crying, I would have had second thoughts about seeing it.

I will admit I had some qualms about the rapes beforehand, but after actually watching them, they weren\\'t as bad as everyone says they were.

Other problems with this film include the awful, awful and again I say AWFUL acting! half the cast lumbered around the set with expressions akin to that of a constipated person attempting to expel the poo equivalent of breeze blocks while the other half simply looked bored brainless. The script was limited and clichéd while the screenplay leaped and bobbed from one scene to the next with convoluted traffic sounds and blurred neon lights streaking across the lens until I wasn\\'t sure if I was watching a film or someone just had slipped LSD into my drink! The story itself was a problem in as much as it evokes a \"\"what was the point of this?\"\" sentiment because as far as characterisation is concerned there are no sympathetic or really likable characters as any plights and/or sufferings they endured to get them where they are in life was completely overshadowed by the insufferable script, horrific acting and general pointlessness of it all. Over all I have given it one out of ten, primarily because the voting system doesn\\'t work in minus numbers, and secondarily there is no worthwhile story to any of it, just that everybody is getting revenge on someone else for something or other and/or avoiding being killed in retribution for..I don\\'t\\'t know! lets just say running over the neighbour\\'s gerbil! basically a dire waste of time for anyone who thinks films should contain a bit more than just gallons of strawberry compote...er I mean \"\"blood\"\" flying around in all directions for no reason apparent to the logical human mind....\",/review/rw1328050/?ref_=tt_urv\\r\\n300,30 January 2014,james-calver,8,\" You know you\\'re odd when you\\'re the only one that doesn\\'t look away...but if you don\\'t!\\n\",\"To put it simply, if you don\\'t like a tiny bit of gore, then maybe you shouldn\\'t watch this movie. However, if you can put up with a little bit (minor misjudgement) of blood on the screen, then this film is definitely under the bracket of masterpiece. The story, while at first hard to follow, is pure genius, complex enough to create interesting enigma\\'s, but not so complex you lose track of where the film is going, and therefore interest. The other point to make is the use of the violence. Whilst the redness of the blood could be compared to Argento or either of the Kill Bill\\'s, Miike\\'s excessive use is genuinely jaw-dropping. The people I viewed the film with found many of the images disturbing, but when analysed, they add a deeper layer to the film than what first appears on the screen. All except one piece of the violent imagery are done concocted with outstanding visual effects, and make even some Hollywood films look basic.

The most hilarious splatter film i have ever seen, spliced with some rather disturbing comments about a character\\'s desire to rape. It was screened as Ichi the Killer in Vancouver, and the two girls i saw it with absolutely hated it.  However, i must say it was rich with enjoyable characters, and enjoyable ways for those characters to give up the ghost. 8 out of 10.

Some of the carnage (Ichi\\'s raid on a roomful of gangsters, with blood flying out of the door in torrents, a la Monty Python) is hilarious and has its place in the story, but by the final third of the film, Miike piles on far too many scenes of more realistic cruelty and perversity, seemingly for no reason.\",/review/rw1328050/?ref_=tt_urv\\r\\n314,25 June 2005,h0rr0r-1,10,\" Best Movie I Ever Seen!\\n\",\"First off I would like to say I have seen many movies here in the USA and I own over 500 DVDs.

It\\'s also satiric, hilarious, thoughtful, and subversive. To dismiss this film as \"\"childish\"\" is to dismiss its style and innovation. \"\"Ichi\"\" is not for the faint of heart OR mind. You must be prepared to be challenged visually and intellectually. The plot is far more complex than most mainstream American films; it twists upon itself many times and contains several parallel tracks. The imagery pushes the boundaries of what can be imagined, assisted by a healthy dose of CG gore for when physical effects just couldn\\'t cut it. But, as with all great films, it is the characters that drive the story, and this is what puts \"\"Ichi\"\" above typical exploitative dreck. The characters are unique, well-rounded, full of flaws and virtues. You may not agree with their motivations, but you will understand them. This film is carefully planned and lovingly crafted; this isn\\'t your old 42nd Street grindhouse fare.

I won\\'t go off on any rants about performances or the underlying and darkest of humor present in the film. I think some of the other comments covered all of that quite well. I will, however, repeat that this flick truly needs to be seen to understand the level of brutality Miike captured; psychologically and physically with these unique characters. It\\'s one of those films that makes you question (as a viewer) if you should feel ashamed, or like you\\'ve somehow done something wrong for thinking that it kicks ass.

I\\'m sure that it was done on purpose (the fact that they made a point to show Jijii lifting up Kaki\\'s bangs is evidence of that), but what exactly happened?
